The super simulations are run on the Ng=64 data from the simulation PART_010.
The different road explored are: 
- original 8x super resolution. This one can be random_sampled to different Ng.
- downsample the original 64^3 array by a factor of 2^3 then modified the generator to upsample by this factor (so LR=32, HR=64, SR=2x32=64)

The dimension of the simulation box are in kpc, the pk.py script convert them in Mpc/h. 

The core name are HR: sim/PART_010 (the original simulation), the LR
